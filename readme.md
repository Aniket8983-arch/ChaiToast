## 🌍 Problem Statement

Build a digital solution that improves waste segregation and collection at the source.

Traditional waste management systems rely on manual segregation, leading to:
- Human error
- Unsafe handling
- Inefficient collection
- No real-time monitoring

Our system provides an AI-powered automated solution to address these challenges.

## 🚀 Solution Overview

This project integrates **Machine Learning + IoT + Embedded Systems** to:

- 📷 Capture waste image
- 🤖 Classify waste using ML model
- 🔌 Communicate with ESP32
- ⚙ Automatically rotate servo flap
- 📊 Monitor bin fill level (10 flaps capacity per side)
- 📧 Notify central manager when bin is full
- 🏆 Reward users with points

---

## 🧠 System Architecture

### 1️⃣ Image Capture & AI Processing
- Laptop camera captures waste image
- TensorFlow/Keras model predicts:
  - BIO (Biodegradable)
  - NONBIO (Non-Biodegradable)

### 2️⃣ Serial Communication
- Python sends `'B'` or `'N'` via serial
- ESP32 receives command

### 3️⃣ Servo-Based Automated Sorting
- Servo motor rotates:
  - 45° → Biodegradable
  - 135° → Non-Biodegradable
- Returns to neutral position

### 4️⃣ Smart Collection Monitoring
- Independent bin tracking (10 items per side)
- Fill percentage displayed
- Email alert when bin is full
